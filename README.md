# Candidate Search Application

## Description

## Installation

Install Vite (npm create vite)
Install dependencies (npm install)

## Usage

The user starts the application by using the command “npm run dev”. The page loads a new candidate every time it refreshes and every time the user saves or skips a candidate. Recruiters can browse and manage potential candidates by searching GitHub profiles and viewing essential candidate details. In the "potential candidates" section, users can access a comprehensive list of previously saved profiles presented in a structured table format, making it easy to compare candidates. The system ensures persistence by storing saved profiles in the browser’s local storage, allowing users to revisit their selections even after refreshing the page. Users are also able to delete saved profiles of candidates they are no longer interested in.
